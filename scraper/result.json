      "desc": "Best of ASTRO India Annual Meeting 2018 is organized by Association of Radiation Oncologists of India, West Bengal Chapter (AROIWB) and will be held from Jun 29 - 30, 2019 at Taj Bengal Kolkata, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.\n\nTarget Audience:\nThis live activity is designed to meet the interests of radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, surgeons, physicists, nurses, diagnostic radiologists, pathologists, radiation therapists, radiation dosimetrists and radiation oncology residents.\n\nDescription:\nThe Best of ASTRO India meeting is an officially licensed two-day summary of the most relevant, highly-rated abstracts from the Annual Meeting of ASTRO, that highlight recent technological advances and illustrate the importance of the clinical and non-clinical skills needed to provide patients with the full benefit of radiation oncology.\n\nStatement of need:\nThere are numerous advances in patient safety in the context of radiation therapy delivery, clinical research on treatment options and advanced techniques in radiotherapy delivery. Failure to stay up-to-date can result in lower quality of care by practicing clinicians. Given the time and breadth of knowledge required to stay up-to-date on advances in cancer therapy, in radiotherapy but also its combination with other treatment modalities, it can be very difficult for a busy practitioner to be knowledgeable about all high-impact new advances and its relevant literature affecting their practice.\n\nProgram Objectives\nUpon completion of this live activity, attendees should be able to:\n• Describe the most current data guiding cancer management decisions.\n• Utilize modern radiation technology to improve patient care.\n• Implement quality and safety measures in the delivery of radiation therapy.\n\nAdditional details will be posted as soon as they are available.                                \n                                                                \n                                  \n                                                                      \n                    \n                                    \n                                                    \n                                            View All91\n                                         Speaking\n                                                                                                                    \n\n                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                                                \n\n                                                                \n\n                                                                    Koustav Mazumder\n\n                                                                    \n                                                            Radiation Oncology                                                                    \n                                                                  \n                                                                \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n\n                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                                                \n\n                                                                \n\n                                                                    Pranav Chadha\n\n                                                                    \n                                                            Radiation Oncology                                                                    \n                                                                  \n                                                                \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n\n                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                                                \n\n                                                                \n\n                                                                    Gaurav Goswami\n\n                                                                    \n                                                            Radiation Oncology                                                                    \n                                                                  \n                                                                \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                            \n                                                                \n\n    \n                                                                                \n                                    \n                                  \n                                \n                                        \n                   \n                                                                      \n                                        Conference Details\n                                        \n                                                                                   Scientific Poster : View Poster \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Session url : Click here"

It is therefore crucial that medical practitioners that attend to diabetics are well equipped and trained in insulin management to provide optimum care.\n\nAssimilate, along with Medvarsity, is conducting a unique one-day interactive workshop, specially designed to tackle everyday issues, concerns, and problem-solving when treating insulin-dependent patients. The participants will get to learn a pragmatic approach to insulin management through group exercises, case discussions, and didactic presentation.\n\nWho Should Attend:\n• Practicing Physicians in Internal Medicine/General Medicine/Family Medicine Disciplines and Postgraduate Residents of the same\n• Practicing Clinicians from other specialties (Surgery, Pediatrics, Obstetrics, etc.)\n• Practicing MBBS doctors who manage diabetic patients every day\n• General Practitioners and Resident Doctors\n\nWorkshop Objectives:\n• Gain a broader understanding of insulin management\n• Possess a new set of tools in insulin management\n• Gain knowledge in managing patients on various insulin regimens\n• Tackle the common complications & special scenarios in insulin-dependent patients\n\nAdditional details will be posted as soon as they are available.                                \n                                                                \n                                  \n                                                                      \n                    \n                                    \n                                                    \n                                            2\n                                         Speaking\n                                                                                                                    \n\n                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                                                \n\n                                                                \n\n                                                                    D.
